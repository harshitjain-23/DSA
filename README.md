### Topics Covered in DSA

# 1️⃣ Data Structures (DS)
Data structures are categorized into two types:

## Linear Data Structures

# Arrays: 
        Fixed-size collection of elements.
# Linked List: 
        Nodes linked together dynamically.
# Stack: 
        Last In, First Out (LIFO) structure (e.g., backtracking, undo operations).
# Queue: 
        First In, First Out (FIFO) structure (e.g., scheduling).
# Deque (Double-Ended Queue): 
        Insert and delete from both ends.
# Hash Table / HashMap: 
        Key-value pair storage for fast lookups.


## Non-Linear Data Structures

# Trees: 
        Hierarchical data structure (e.g., Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees).
# Graphs: 
        Nodes (vertices) connected by edges (e.g., Social Networks, Maps).
# Heaps: 
        Specialized tree-based structure for priority queues.
# Tries (Prefix Trees): 
        Used for searching words efficiently (e.g., Auto-suggestions).
